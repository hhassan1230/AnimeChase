## Background

We wanted to make this app because:
- We had No idea what Anime to watch.
- We had No idea about what new Anime coming out.
- We Wanted to Find new Amazing Animes by themes and genres

## Features

Find Animes by
1. Titles
2. Genres
3. Most Recent Release
4. Top Animes
5. Randomly

And the page anime with show stats on the anime with the ablity to save the title to a anime watch list linked to your facebook account.

## Usage

## Development/Contribution

We are still looking for a api that would be able to find full free episodes for most amine titles in the world. If it has a gem that would be amazing!!!!

## Future

Features we are currently working on: 
- Open the app up to search Manga (Japanese comics)
